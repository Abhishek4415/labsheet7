Problem Description 
1. Tree Implementations: 
o Implement AVL trees to manage hierarchical data of affected regions. 
o Perform tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and balancing. 
o Implement tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) to retrieve information about 
affected areas. 
2. Graph Implementations: 
o Represent the disaster-affected regions and resource centers using graphs (adjacency lists and 
adjacency matrices). 
o Implement graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) to navigate through the network of affected areas 
and resource centers. 
o Implement shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford) to determine the quickest route for 
resource delivery. 
o Implement spanning tree algorithms (Prim’s and Kruskal’s) to establish efficient communication 
networks. 
3. Disaster Response Management System: 
o Develop a user interface to manage and visualize the affected areas, resource centers, and rescue 
operations. 
o Allow users to interact with the system (e.g., add/remove affected areas, visualize resource 
distribution routes, manage rescue operations).
